# LU-Decomposition-using-Parallel-Programming
In this project, I have implemented LU Decomposition using Gaussian Elimination with row pivoting which factorize a dense N Ã— N matrix into an upper- triangular and a lower-triangular one. I have made 3 implementations of it. Sequential version and two parallel versions using OpenMP and PThread respectively.
